<h3 id="whatisadwords">What is AdWords?</h3>
<p>
AdWords is an online advertising platform developed by Google, which allows businesses to display their ads on Google's search engine results pages (SERPs) and partner websites. It operates on a pay-per-click (PPC) model, meaning that advertisers only pay when someone clicks on their ads. AdWords offers a highly targeted and measurable way to reach potential customers, making it a popular choice for businesses of all sizes.
</p>
<h3 id="howdoesadwordswork">How Does AdWords Work?</h3>
<p>
When a user performs a search on Google, AdWords uses an auction-based system to determine which ads will be displayed. Advertisers bid on keywords relevant to their products or services, and Google takes into account the bid amount and the ad's quality score to determine the ad's position on the SERP. The higher the bid and quality score, the better the ad's placement.
