          5 Online Businesses You Can Start with Zero Investment
        </h1>
        <p><b>Category : </b> <span id="category">MMT</span></p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In today&apos;s digital age, starting an online business has become
          easier than ever. The best part is that you don&apos;t always need a
          large sum of money to get started. With the right ideas and
          strategies, you can launch a profitable online venture with zero
          investment. In this article, we will explore five online businesses
          that you can start without spending a dime. Whether you&apos;re a
          stay-at-home parent, a student, or simply looking for a side hustle,
          these zero-investment online businesses offer immense potential for
          success.
        </p>
        <h2>
          1. Dropshipping: Launching an E-commerce Store without Inventory
        </h2>
        <p>
          Dropshipping has gained tremendous popularity as a business model that
          requires minimal investment. It involves setting up an online store
          and partnering with suppliers who handle inventory and shipping.
          Here&apos;s how it works:
        </p>
        <p>How Does Dropshipping Work?</p>
        <p>
          In dropshipping, you list products on your online store without
          actually stocking them. When a customer places an order, you forward
          it to the supplier, who then ships the product directly to the
          customer. Your profit is the difference between the supplier&apos;s
          price and the amount you charge the customer. This model allows you to
          focus on marketing and customer service without worrying about
          inventory management.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Affiliate Marketing: Promoting Products for Commissions</h2>
        <p>
          Affiliate marketing is another zero-investment business that can be
          highly lucrative. It involves promoting other companies&apos; products
          or services and earning a commission for each sale or lead generated
          through your affiliate links.
